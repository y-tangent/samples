- Model Based Definition (MBD) is a `mechanical engineering initiative` where a 3D model with Product Manufacturing Information (PMI) augments or replaces a 2D engineering drawing as design documentation.
- Model Based Enterprise (MBE) is a `company wide initiative` to augment 3D models with additional information to create new documentation deliverables beyond engineering.
- Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) is a `system engineering initiative` to create a digital model of a system that is used by all engineering disciplines and other functional organizations within a company.
- Model Based Development is a `embedded software initiative` where a two-sided model is used to verify control requirements and that the code runs on target electronic hardware.
